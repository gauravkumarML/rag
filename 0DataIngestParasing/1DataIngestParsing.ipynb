BERCER \\nBowling Green State University \\nROBERT W. MOTL \\nUniversity of Georgia \\nThis paper highlights the use of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in physical \\nactivity research by reviewing and synthesizing literature generated in exercise \\nsettings. The results of many studies using the POMS have supported the rela- \\ntionships between exercise and acute mood changes in normal populations and \\nbetween exercise and chronic mood changes in clinical populations. Based on the \\nmultitude of studies utilizing the POMS, Berger and colleagues developed a pre- \\nliminary taxonomy containing enjoyment, mode, and practice guidelines to help \\nmaximize the mood benefits associated with exercise. The POMS also has been \\nemployed to identify underlying mechanisms that may promote mood alteration. \\nUnfortunately, there is no conclusive evidence that identifies a single mechanism \\nor group of mechanisms as consistently influencing the exercise-mood relation- \\nship. Although knowledge of the relationship between exercise and mood alter- \\nation is substantial, much remains to be studied. Promising avenues for future \\ninvestigation of exercise include mood changes in specific populations, environ- \\nmental influences on mood alteration, and personal characteristics impacting mood \\nalteration. \\nMood refers to a host of transient, fluctuating affective states (McNair, \\nLon; & Droppleman, 1971, 1981, 1992) that reflect how an individual \\nfeels in general or globally at a particular moment in time. Moods range \\non a continuum from pleasurable to unpleasurable feeling states. In ad- \\nBonnie G. Berger, Bowling Green State University, School of HMSLS; Robert W.

Moods have postural and behavioral indicators such as \\nslumped shoulders, facial expressions, ways of walking, and whistling. \\nAlthough the terms mood and emorion reflect affective states, moods per- \\nsist for longer periods of time, tend to be less intense, and do not appear \\nto have distinct or specific causes (Morris, 1989; Thayer, 1989, 1996). \\nThe Pervasiveness of Mood \\nMood is an integral component of daily life. It serves as a barometer \\nof our general state of psychological well-being, can alter general behav- \\nior patterns, and influences physical health (Cohen & Rodriguez, 1995; \\nParkinson, Totterdell, Briner, & Reynolds, 1996). Mood is related to psy- \\nchological well-being as evidenced by one’s general level of enjoyment, \\nself-concept, and subjective well-being (e.g., Thayer, 1996). Mood also \\ninfluences our lives by affecting a diverse array of behaviors such as \\nhelping others (Moms, 1989; Parkinson et al., 1996) and recalling mem- \\norable events (Mayer, McCormick, & Strong, 1995). \\nMood and physical health are bi-directionally related in ways that are \\njust beginning to be understood (Cohen & Rodriguez, 1995). Distinct \\nconnections between mood and health include influences on health habits, \\nthe immune system, and the onset and time-course of specific diseases \\n(Melamed, 1995). Mood has been related to the functioning of the im- \\nmune system by affecting both the number and activity of B and T lym- \\nphocytes, macrophages, leukocytes. antibodies, and reactivity to antigens \\nand pathogens (Maier, Watkins, & Fleshner, 1994). The onset of specific \\ndiseases and their response to treatment also may be associated with mood \\nas postulated in models of bi-directional pathways (Cohen & Rodriguez, \\n1995; Thayer, 1989). Health habits and behaviors likely to be related to \\nmood include dietary intake and eating patterns that have direct affects \\non obesity and eating disorders (Thayer, 1989). Other health habits related \\nto mood states include the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs as \\nwell as exercise adoption and adherence (Cohen & Rodriguez, 1995; \\nThayer, 1989, 1996). \\nThe pervasiveness of mood illustrates that its self-regulation may be \\nan essential factor for establishing healthy habits and lifestyle behaviors \\nas well as for personal happiness. With or without conscious awareness, \\nwe try to maintain good moods and to mitigate negative moods (Parkin- \\nson et al., 1996; Thayer, 1996; Thayer, Newman, & McClain, 1994). Self- \\nregulation of mood is particularly important when a person is in a neg- \\native mood and wants to avoid the automatic effects of mood which \\nproduce mood-congruent thoughts and behaviors as well as vicious cy- \\ncling (Morris. 1989). Diverse techniques to regulate mood include listen- \\ning to music (McKinney, Antoni, Kumar, Tims, & McCabe, 1997) as well \\nas employing phototherapy techniques and exercising (e.g., Thayer, 1996). \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='EXERCISE AND MOOD AS MEASURED BY THE POMS 71 \\nMood and Exercise \\nThere is a strong consensus that mood enhancement is a primary benefit \\nof physical activity (e.g., Berger, 1996; Berger & McInman, 1993; Inter- \\nnational Society of Sport Psychology, 1991; Morgan, 1997~). In a position \\nstatement describing the psychological benefits of physical activity, the \\nInternational Society of Sport Psychology (1991) concluded that exercise \\nhas been related to desirable changes in mood. Based on a systematic \\nanalysis of self-regulation techniques, Thayer and colleagues ( 1994) re- \\nported that exercise was the most effective of 10 general behavioral tech- \\nniques used to self-regulate moods in normal populations. More specifi- \\ncally, exercise “was self-rated as the most successful at changing a bad \\nmood, fourth most successful at raising energy, and third or fourth most \\nsuccessful at tension reduction” (p. 921). In addition, psychotherapists \\nrated active mood management, which included exercise, as the most \\neffective technique for changing a bad mood (Thayer et al., 1994). The \\nrecent report by the United States Department of Health and Human Ser- \\nvices (1996) also indicates that physical activity is associated with im- \\nprovements in mood states such as anxiety and depression. \\nTo examine the mood changes associated with physical activity, re- \\nsearchers have employed a variety of self-report inventories. Basically, \\nmeasures of mood can be partitioned into general and exercise-specific \\ninventories. General measures of mood include the Activation-Deactiva- \\ntion Adjective Check List (Thayer, 1986), Beck Depression Inventory \\n(Beck, Ward, Mendelsohn, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961), Multiple Adjective \\nCheck List (Nowlis, 1965), Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (Wat- \\nson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, \\nGorsuch, & Lushene, 1970), and the Profile of Mood States (POMS; \\nMcNair et al., 1971, 1981, 1992). The POMS is the focus of this review. \\nRecently, the validity and reliability of using many of the general ques- \\ntionnaires in exercise settings have been questioned (cf. Crocker, 1997). \\nTo measure the affective states associated with physical activity itself, \\nresearchers have begun to develop exercise-specific measures of mood \\nsuch as the Exercise-Induced Feeling Inventory (Gauvin & Rejeski, 1993) \\nand the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale (McAuley & Courneya, \\n1994). The Exercise-Induced Feeling Inventory has 12-items and four \\nsubscales: revitalization, tranquillity, positive engagement, and physical \\nexhaustion. The 12-item Subjective Exercise Experience Scale measures \\npositive well-being, psychological distress, and fatigue. These exercise- \\nspecific measures, however, may not capture the influence of exercise on \\nthe mood states associated with activitiedevents of daily living such as \\ntension, depression, anger, and confusion. Additionally, there is little nor- \\nmative data for these relatively new inventories, and thus they are not yet \\nconducive to cross-study comparisons. \\nUse of the POMS in Exercise Settings \\nThe POMS has been a widely used measure of mood in physical ac- \\ntivity research.

Between 1991 and 1996, there were more than 80 studies (Bour- \\ngeois, 1996). The original version of the POMS was developed in 1971 \\nand consisted of 65 items; an abbreviated 30-item version of the POMS \\nhas been developed more recently (McNair et al., 1971, 1981, 1992). On \\nboth versions, respondents rate each item on a 5-point Likert scale with \\nanchors ranging between “Not at all” to “Extremely.” Items are com- \\nbined to form six separate subscales: tension-anxiety, depression-dejec- \\ntion, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewil- \\nderment. The subscale scores can be combined to form an overall measure \\nof affect that is labeled total mood disturbance (TMD). The separate sub- \\nscales are useful when researchers are interested in examining changes in \\nspecific moods; TMD is useful in studies containing a small number of \\nparticipants or when researchers are interested in a single, global estimate \\nof affective states. This paper highlights the use of the Profile of Mood \\nStates in physical activity research by reviewing and synthesizing litera- \\nture generated in exercise settings. \\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of the POMS \\nBefore reviewing the POMS literature, it is important to acknowledge \\nthe advantages and disadvantages of utilizing this measure in exercise \\nsettings. One primary advantage of the POMS is that it appears to be \\nuseful in detecting mood fluctuations associated with exercise. As noted \\nin the manual, “The POMS also has proved to be a sensitive measure of \\nthe effects of various experimental manipulations upon normal subjects \\nand other nonpsychiatric populations” (McNair et al., 197 1, 1981, 1992, \\np. 1). This sensitivity has enabled researchers to examine a broad base of \\nfactors within exercise and sport settings. Some of these factors include \\nexercise duration and intensity (e.g., Berger, Grove, Prapavessis, & Butki, \\n1997; Morgan, Costill, Flynn, Raglin, & O’Connor, 1988; Motl, Berger, \\n& Wilson, 1996), specific participant populations (e.g., Nelson & Morgan, \\n1994; Steptoe, Kearsley, & Walters, 1993), and exercise modes conducive \\nto mood alteration (e.g., Berger & Owen, 1988, 1992a). Another advan- \\ntage of the POMS is that the six subscales seem to be measuring mood \\nsubcomponents which are differentially responsive to diverse character- \\nistics of exercise settings. Furthermore, normative data for specific groups, \\nincluding adults and frequently-studied college students, is helpful for \\nstatistical and practical interpretation of POMS scores (Lane & Terry, \\n1998; McNair et al., 1971, 1981, 1992). The large body of normative data \\nand the available exercise literature employing the POMS also facilitates \\ncross-study comparisons. \\nThe POMS also has disadvantages which need to acknowledged when \\ninterpreting the meaning of POMS results. One disadvantage is that the \\nPOMS initially was developed for use with clinical populations. However, \\nthe normative data available for normal and physically active populations \\nexpands its usefulness. Another disadvantage of the POMS is that five of \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='EXERCISE AND MOOD AS MEASURED BY THE POMS 73 \\nthe six subscales measure the negative mood characteristics of tension, \\ndepression, anger, fatigue, and confusion. It is difficult to conceptualize \\nwhether a decrease in a negative mood state actually indicates mood ben- \\nefits. However, a decrease in tension, depression, and anger seems to \\ntranslate into an experience of “feeling better” as initially described by \\nMorgan (1985). Another disadvantage of the POMS is that the reputed 3 \\nto 5 minutes for completing the inventory can require additional time in \\nolder populations and those experiencing chronic pain. Repeated admin- \\nistrations of the full length POMS also can be intrusive. Consequently, \\nthere are shortened versions of the POMS that contain between 6 and 32 \\nitems (Grove & Prapavessis, 1992; McNair et al., 1971, 1981, 1992; \\nShacham, 1983; Terry, Keohane, & Lane, 1996; Whelan & Meyers, \\n1998). \\nMethodological and Design Concerns \\nIn addition to the advantages and disadvantages associated with using \\nthe Profile of Mood States, there are general methodology and design \\nissues that require careful consideration when examining the relationship \\nbetween physical activity and mental health. Key methodological con- \\ncerns include randomization, suitable control conditions, and appropriate \\nsample size and power. Design concerns also are important to consider \\nand include controlling for expectancy as well as other third-variable in- \\nfluences, and employing state-of-the-art statistical analyses (e.g., Morgan, \\n1997b; Schutz & Gessaroli, 1993). Some of the methodological and de- \\nsign concerns reflect a lack of knowledge and oversight. Others reflect \\nthe difficulty of conducting research in the area of exercise and mood \\nalteration. For example, exercise participants should be randomly assigned \\nto treatment. However, personal considerations such as exercise prefer- \\nences, time schedules, and hypothesis testing may preclude random as- \\nsignment of participants. \\nBecause design flaws permeate many studies, results of research in the \\narea of exercise and mood should be interpreted cautiously to avoid mak- \\ning overly enthusiastic, sometimes unsubstantiated claims. Currently, no \\ndefinitive statements can be made regarding a causal relationship between \\nphysical activity and mood enhancement. The underlying mechanisms of \\nobserved mood changes also remain unclear. To enhance our understand- \\ning of the exercise-mood relationship, future studies need to be based on \\ntheoretical models, employ appropriate and powerful research designs, \\nand focus specifically on acute andlor chronic exercise programs with \\ncarefully defined training protocols (Morgan, 1997b; Schutz & Gessaroli, \\n1993). As emphasized in the next section, psychological characteristics \\nof the participant such as mental-health status even may have implications \\nfor the complex relationship between physical activity and mood. \\nMood Responses to Exercise in Normal Populations as Indicated by the \\nPOMS \\nShort-term or acute mood benefits for members of “normal” popula- \\ntions have been associated with participation in a wide range of physical \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='Downloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content=\"Table 1 \\nContinued \\nActivities and authors Sex Age (years) Duration Intensity POMS subscale changes' $?

As illustrated in Table 1, the acute mood benefits have included \\ndecreases in tension, depression, anger, and confusion. There have been \\nchanges on vigor and fatigue as measured by the POMS, but these have \\nbeen in both desirable and undesirable directions. Some of the physical \\nactivities associated with mood enhancement include aerobic dance, cir- \\ncuit training, cycling, Hatha yoga, jogging, rock climbing, swimming, Tai \\nchi, and weight-training. Mood benefits have been reported by women \\nand men of various ages participating primarily in moderate-intensity ex- \\nercise for 20 to 75 minutes. (See columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Table 1 for \\nparticipant and exercise characteristics in the various studies of the ex- \\nercise and mood relationship.) Other studies finding little or no evidence \\nof acute mood improvements on the POMS attribute lack of change to \\nunpleasant environmental conditions such as excessive heat and high- \\nintensity exercise (e.g., Berger & Owen, 1986, 1992b; Boutcher & Land- \\ners, 1988). Given the preponderance of positive research findings, it is \\nsafe to conclude that a single exercise session has been associated with \\nmood benefits as indicated by changes on various POMS subscales. \\nChronic mood changes as measured by the POMS also have been re- \\nlated to exercise for members of normal populations. However, these re- \\nsults have been more equivocal than the short-term changes. Some re- \\nsearchers have found that exercise programs ranging from several weeks \\nto several months were conducive to chronic improvements in mood (e.g., \\nBrown et al., 1995; Steptoe, Edwards, Moses, & Mathews, 1989). Other \\nresearchers have failed to produce evidence that long-term exercise pro- \\ngrams were associated with improved mood states (e.g., Berger, Friedman, \\n& Eaton, 1988: King. Taylor, Haskell. & DeBusk, 1989). Mood by def- \\ninition is transient and fluctuating (McNair et al., 1971, 1981, 1992), and \\nthus it is difficult to interpret the actual meaning of chronic mood changes \\nin exercise settings for individuals who are not anxious or depressed. \\nChronic mood changes may reflect altered dispositional mood state, psy- \\nchological health, the time of year, life experiences (e.g., marriage, job \\npromotion), expectancy of benefits, improved fitness, or simply being \\nhappy that the study is finished. As Martinsen and Morgan (1997) noted, \\nit is unlikely that exercise will induce chronic changes in mood for in- \\ndividuals who score within normal ranges on the POMS subscales. \\nMoocl Respoiises to Exercise in Clinical Popirlations as Indicated by \\nthe POMS \\nInitially, the POMS was developed for use with psychiatric outpatients \\nto assess their mood responses to therapeutic treatments (McNair et al., \\n1971, 1981, 1992). Although the POMS should be an ideal measure of \\nthe mood changes associated with exercise for members of clinical pop- \\nulations with affective disorders, few researchers have employed the \\nPOMS to examine acute mood responses to exercise for individuals in \\nthis context. In one study, women who were depressed (n = 6) reported \\ndecreases in depression and total mood disturbance on the POMS when \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 9, 'page_label': '10'}, page_content='EXERCISE. AND MOOD AS MEASURED BY THE POMS 77 \\ntested immediately before and after exercising at 40%, 60%, and 80% of \\nestimated VO, max (Nelson & Morgan, 1994). No mood changes were \\nnoted for the non-depressed females (n = 5) who completed the same \\nbouts of exercise. This study provided preliminary support for acute mood \\nbenefits with exercise in depressed populations, but it requires replication \\ngiven the small sample size. To our knowledge, there is no research in \\nexercise settings that investigates acute mood changes as measured by the \\nPOMS in individuals with anxiety disorders. \\nWhen researchers have observed long-term changes on the POMS sub- \\nscales, the chronic mood benefits have been primarily for individuals \\nencountering clinical levels of depression or anxiety (Martinsen, 1993; \\nMartinsen & Morgan, 1997). Some studies indicated that for individuals \\nwith mild to moderate depression, as determined by the Beck Depression \\nInventory (Beck et al., 1961), exercise was as effective as cognitive ther- \\napy and cognitive therapy-plus-exercise for chronic improvements on ten- \\nsion, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion (Fremont & Craig- \\nhead, 1987; Harris, 1987). For individuals labeled as anxious, moderate- \\nintensity exercise was more effective than an attention-control placebo \\ncondition for long-term mood improvements on the POMS (Steptoe, Ed- \\nwards, Moses, & Mathews, 1989). These studies support the contention \\nthat chronic mood changes on the POMS are associated with exercise in \\nindividuals who display initial mood disturbances. \\nPreliminary Taxonomy to Maximize Mood Benefits: As Measured \\nby the POMS \\nContrary to the impressions fostered by the popular press and the Nike \\nadvertisement of “Pure pleasure no matter how damn hard it may be,” \\nthe mood benefits of physical activity are not automatic. In addition, the \\nmechanisms underlying both acute and chronic mood change such as \\nelevation of body temperature, endorphin level, time out, and enhanced \\nself-concept remain speculative (e.g., Morgan, 1997b). \\nDesirable changes in mood seem to be dependent upon complex inter- \\nactions among the participant, exercise mode, and exercise practice con- \\nditions (Boutcher & Landers, 1988; Morgan, 1997~). Recognizing these \\ncomplex interactions, Berger and colleagues (e.g., Berger 1996; Berger \\n& Owen 1988, 1998; Berger et al., 1997; Motl, Berger, & Leuschen, in \\npress) have developed a preliminary taxonomy to identify factors that \\nmay help to maximize the mood benefits associated with physical activity. \\n(See Figure 1.) The taxonomy is presented here as a framework for in- \\nvestigating some of the factors influencing the relationship between mood \\nalteration and physical activity. The relationship between the taxonomy \\nfactors and mood change appears to be interactive. Some of the factors \\nare based on research utilizing the POMS. Other factors are more spec- \\nulative and will require revision as new, related research becomes avail- \\nable.

Physical activities differ from one another \\nin a number of ways. However, four aspects of exercise mode seem par- \\nticularly conducive to mood improvement: (a) abdominal and rhythmical \\nbreathing, (b) relative absence of interpersonal competition, (c) closed or \\npredictable activities, and (d) are repetitive and rhythmical movements \\n(Berger, 1996; Berger & Owen, 1988). \\nAbdominal and rhythmical breathing. This mode requirement suggests \\nthat exercise should promote rhythmical and abdominal breathing. Al- \\nthough the research literature implies that aerobic exercise is necessary \\nfor mood enhancement (e.g., Berger, 1994; Dyer & Crouch, 1988), par- \\nticipants in other types of exercise also have reported mood benefits as \\nmeasured by the POMS (e.g., Berger & Owen, 1988, 1992a; Jin, 1992). \\nIn addition, the definition of aerobic exercise is somewhat unclear. Pre- \\nsumably, aerobic exercise is performed in a heart rate training zone of \\napproximately 60% to 90% of maximal heart rate (American College of \\nSports Medicine, 1995). \\nInvestigating the need for aerobic exercise, Berger and Owen (1992a) \\nfound that participants in Hatha yoga, an activity with few aerobic train- \\ning benefits, reported as many mood benefits on the POMS as individuals \\nwho participated in swimming. Participants in brisk walking, Tai chi, and \\nmeditation also reported similar acute mood benefits on all six POMS \\nsubscales (Jin, 1992). Based on recent evidence, Berger (1996) suggested \\nthat the aerobic guideline be changed to a requirement for rhythmical, \\nabdominal breathing since swimming, walking, meditation, Tai chi, and \\nyoga as well as most aerobic activities promote such breathing patterns. \\nFurther supporting this guideline reconfiguration, rhythmical abdominal \\nbreathing is a central component in many stress reduction and meditative \\ntechniques. Although the rhythmical, abdominal breathing requirement is \\nlogical, it requires considerably more research. \\nRelative absence of interpersonal competition. If an individual is in- \\nterested in maximizing the mood benefits associated with exercise, a rel- \\native absence of competition is desirable. Competition can be detrimental \\nto mood for many reasons. One is event outcome. Theoretically, 50% of \\nthe participants in any competition lose a match or contest. Even if an \\nindividual is fortunate enough to be on a winning team, the player may \\nbe unhappy with hisher own performance. For many individuals, the \\nfocus of competition seems to emphasize the end-product of winning, \\nrather than the process of participating for enjoyment of the activity itself \\n(Duda, 1996). \\nInterpersonal competition, losing, and self-criticism probably are not \\nconducive to mood enhancement.

Intramural participants in basketball and volleyball re- \\nported overall mood disturbances immediately after exercising. When ex- \\namining the mood changes of competitive sport more closely, it became \\napparent that winning and losing (i.e., event outcome) influenced mood \\nchange. Individuals on losing teams reported decreases in vigor and in- \\ncreases in anger and TMD. Individuals on winning teams reported mood \\nbenefits on the six POMS subscales (Berger et al., 1995). Similar effects \\nof winning and losing on desirable and undesirable mood changes have \\nbeen reported by Grove and Prapavessis (1992) when the POMS was \\nadministered immediately after exercise. HassmCn and Blomstrand ( 1995) \\nhave reported that the detrimental effects of losing on mood were ob- \\nserved when the POMS was administered immediately and even 2 hours \\nafter exercise. It is unclear whether losing an event, but being satisfied \\nwith one’s performance is conducive to desirable mood change. In sum- \\nmary, it seems that losing a competitive event tends to be associated with \\nmood decrements. \\nClosed, predictable, and repetitive activities. The third mode require- \\nment is the need for a closed or predictable physical activity. As defined \\nby Gentile (1972), closed tasks are characterized by temporal and spatial \\ncertainty (i.e., predictability). Participants in closed activities such as jog- \\nging, swimming, Hatha yoga, and riding a stationary bicycle encounter \\nfew if any unanticipated events. Exercisers in these activities can pre-plan \\ntheir movements, “tune out” the environment, and engage in free asso- \\nciation while they are exercising (Berger, 1994, 1996). Illustrating the \\nimportance of predictable forms of exercise, Berger and Owen (1988) \\nfound that joggers and participants in Hatha yoga reported greater acute \\nmood benefits than did fencers on the POMS subscales of tension, de- \\npression, anger, fatigue, and confusion. Yoga and jogging are closed, pre- \\ndictable, and spatially certain; fencing is a less predictable and more open \\nactivity. Although open activities also may be conducive to mood alter- \\nation for exercisers who prefer to focus their attention outward, there are \\nno studies of which we are aware on this topic. \\nAnother possible mode requirement, a need for the physical activity to \\npromote repetitive and rhythmical movements, has generated little or no \\nresearch. However, personal reports (e.g., Paffenbarger & Olsen, 1996) \\nand the consistent mood benefits of physical activities such as bicycling, \\njogging, and swimming (see Table 1) support inclusion of this factor \\nwithin the taxonomy. The logic underlying this guideline is that repetitive \\nand rhythmical movements do not require much attention. Thus, the par- \\nticipants are free to follow their own train of thought and to let their \\nminds wonder, often finding solutions to nagging problems while exer- \\ncising (e.g., Berger & Mackenzie, 1980; Paffenbarger & Olsen, 1996). \\nThe automaticity and monotony of repetitive movements seem to have \\nan almost hypnotic effect.

However, this mode \\nrequirement remains speculative until research is available on the possible \\nbenefits of repetitive and rhythmical movements. \\nPractice Requirements \\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the practice requirements of frequency, in- \\ntensity, and duration also can influence the relationship between mood \\nand physical activity. It seems that the training guidelines for physical \\nfitness (e.g., American College of Sports Medicine, 1995) and the cus- \\ntomary training regimens of athletes may be different from the exercise \\nguidelines for promoting acute mood benefits. Sport-specific training prin- \\nciples may stimulate performance adaptations, but they probably are not \\nconducive to mood enhancement. Thus, different practice guidelines are \\nneeded to achieve mood benefits. The three practice requirements, which \\nfollow, seem likely to maximize acute mood benefits and to promote the \\nhealth benefits of exercise. \\nFrequency: Regularly included in a weekly schedule. The rationale \\nfor the frequency requirement is that developing and maintaining car- \\ndiovascular and cardiorespiratory fitness enables participants to exercise \\nwith a minimum of unpleasant bodily responses (Berger & McInman, \\n1993) by habituating to the exercise stimulus (Raglin, 1997). By exer- \\ncising at least three times a week, participants can learn to ‘‘listen’’ to \\ntheir bodies, to pace themselves, and to relax while exercising (Berger, \\n1994; Paffenbarger & Olsen, 1996). Supporting a possible relationship \\nbetween fitness status and acute mood change, Steptoe and colleagues \\n( 1993) reported that regular exercisers reported some short-term im- \\nprovements in mood on the POMS following a bout of intense exercise; \\nthe inactive participants reported mood decrements. Similar results were \\nobserved for highly fit and moderately fit exercisers who completed the \\nPOMS before and after intense exercise (Steptoe & Cox, 1988). In ad- \\ndition, the transient and highly fluctuating nature of mood as well as the \\nobservation that mood benefits last between 2 and 4 hours after exercise \\n(Raglin, 1997; Thayer, 1996) both support the need to exercise frequent- \\nly in order to re-establish the benefits. Thus, individuals may need to be \\nphysically active on a regular basis, even daily, to reap the short-term \\nmood benefits. \\nModerate exercise intensity. Moderate intensity exercise may not op- \\ntimize fitness and sports training benefits, but it consistently has been \\nassociated with mood benefits (Berger & Owen, 1988, 1998; Motl et al., \\n1996; Steptoe et al., 1993). In contrast, high-intensity exercise may pro- \\nmote cardiorespiratory and metabolic training benefits, but it has been \\nassociated with few desirable changes in mood (e.g., Berger & Owen, \\n1992b; Motl et al., 1996; O’Conner, 1997). \\nInvestigating the mood changes associated with different exercise in- \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 14, 'page_label': '15'}, page_content='82 BERGER AND MOTL \\ntensities. Mot1 and colleagues (1996) compared the acute mood changes \\namong highly fit collegiate cyclists who rode their bicycle on a stationary \\ntrainer at moderate, high, and maximal exercise intensities. Cyclists re- \\nported short-term improvements on anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion \\nafter the moderate-intensity exercise at 69% of maximal heart rate \\n(HR,,,,,,). High-intensity training (89% HR,,,,,) and maximal-intensity ex- \\nercise to exhaustion were associated with no mood changes and negative \\nmood responses respectively. These differential mood changes were in- \\ndependent of cyclists’ goal orientation toward physical activity. Thus, \\neven in trained cyclists, high-intensity exercise was not associated with \\nmood benefits. \\nRelatively little research is available on the mood changes associated \\nwith low-intensity exercise. Based on the work of Thayer (1987, 1989, \\n1996), it appears that low-intensity exercise such as brisk walking may \\nbe conductive to mood alteration as measured on the Activation-Deac- \\ntivation Adjective Check List. An association between acute mood ben- \\nefits and low-intensity walking/jogging also has been reported by Jin \\n(1992) and by Berger and Owen (1998). Until more is known about the \\nmood benefits of low-intensity exercise and a possible intensity thresh- \\nold, exercise intensity probably should be in the moderate range to en- \\ncourage mood benefits (e.g., Berger, 1996; Berger & McInman, 1993; \\nBerger & Owen, 1988, 1992b). Individual preferences for low-, mod- \\nerate-, or high-intensity exercise (e.g., Mertesdorf, 1994) also may in- \\nfluence the relationship between exercise and mood alteration. Until \\nthere is additional evidence of mood benefits at high- and low-intensities \\nof exercise, moderate-intensity exercise would appear to be a good \\nchoice, unless individuals are certain that they prefer to exercise at high \\nor low intensity. \\nDuration: At least 20 minutes. Many researchers using the POMS have \\nfound mood benefits associated with exercise sessions that are a minimum \\nof 20 to 30 minutes in duration (see Table 1). Exercising for as little as \\n5 to 10 minutes has been associated with desirable mood changes (Thayer, \\n1987, 1996). This shorter exercise duration (i.e., 1 to 20 minutes), how- \\never, requires further research given the small effect size (ES = .04) \\nreported in a meta-analysis by Petruzello, Landers, Hatfield, Kubitz, and \\nSalizar (1991). Exercising for an extended duration which often occurs \\nwith overload training has been associated with either no mood changes \\nte.g., Berger et al., 1997; Hooper, Mackinnon, & Hanrahan, 1997) or with \\nmood disturbances (e.g., O’Connor, Morgan, & Raglin, 1991; Morgan et \\nal., 1988). In a direct examination of the relationship between swimming \\nduration and mood changes, Berger et al. (1997) found that only short- \\nened or taper practices were associated with acute mood benefits for \\nyoung age-group swimmers. Normal-distance practice sessions were as- \\nsociated with mood decrements on the POMS. The guideline of at least \\n20 to 30 minutes of exercise for mood alteration seems to be the most \\ntenable at the present time. \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 15, 'page_label': '16'}, page_content='EXERCISE AND MOOD AS MEASURED BY THE POMS 83 \\nComparative Effectiveness of Exercise and other Mood Alteration \\nApproaches as Indicated by POMS Scores \\nMany other techniques such as the relaxation response, meditation, \\nreading, and social interaction are effective for mood regulation (e.g., \\nParkinson et al., 1996; Thayer, 1996). Comparing these techniques to \\nexercise highlights the relative effectiveness of physical activity for mood \\nalteration and helps to maintain a broad perspective of techniques for \\nself-regulation. Illustrating the relative effectiveness of exercise in partic- \\nipants who were randomly assigned to treatment, Berger et al. (1988) \\nfound that exercise and the highly established relaxation response were \\nassociated with similar short-term reductions on tension, depression, and \\nanger subscales of the POMS. Further illustrating the comparable effects \\nof exercise, Jin (1992) found that following a mentaVemotiona1 stressor, \\nbrisk walking, reading, meditation, and Tai chi were associated with sim- \\nilar acute mood benefits on each of the six POMS subscales. It is impor- \\ntant to note that exercise was not any more effective than other techniques \\nfor mood alteration. However, the comparable benefits of the various strat- \\negies do not diminish the effectiveness of exercise as a mood enhance- \\nment technique. Future studies need to determine whether the mood ben- \\nefits of exercise in comparison to other techniques are associated with \\npossibly different underlying mechanisms, duration of benefits, and pat- \\nterns of change on individual POMS subscales. \\nPossible Causal Mechanisms for the Mood Benefits of Physical \\nActivity: The POMS Research \\nThe exact mechanisms which cause the psychological benefits of phys- \\nical activity are not known. This important, but still unanswered question \\ncontinues to capture the interests of researchers. The possible causes of \\nmood alteration can be separated into three categories of potential mech- \\nanisms: physiological, psychological, and a combination of both. Despite \\ncommon perceptions, there is little research evidence to support any in- \\ndividual or group of factors as consistently producing mood benefits as \\nmeasured by the POMS. The present summary of tenable mechanisms \\npossibly underlying the relationship between mood alteration and physical \\nactivity is limited to research using the POMS. \\nResearch focusing on physiological mechanisms include, but are not \\nlimited to the endorphin, cortisol, monoamine, and thermogenic hypoth- \\neses (see reviews in Morgan, 1997~). Much of the research on physio- \\nlogical mechanisms employing the POMS has been focused on the en- \\ndorphin hypothesis. Researchers have provided some support for the en- \\ndorphin hypothesis when administering the opiate receptor antagonist nal- \\ntrexone and examining the exercise-mood relationship (e.g., Daniel, \\nMartin, & Carter, 1992). Pre-exercise administration of naltrexone inhib- \\nited positive mood changes on the POMS as well as a visual analogue \\nscale following aerobic exercise. However, other studies have not sup- \\nported the endorphin hypothesis.

These same studies suggest that peripheral levels of cor- \\nticotrophin, dopamine, epinephrine, growth hormone, and norepinephrine \\nwere unrelated to mood change on the POMS. Beta-endorphin levels even \\nhave been negatively related to changes in the POMS subscales of de- \\npression and confusion in male exercisers (Kraemer, Dzewaltowski, Blair, \\nRinehardt, & Castracane, 1990). Kraemer and colleagues also found a \\nsimilar inverse relationship between corticotrophin and mood; no asso- \\nciation was apparent for growth hormone. The equivocal relationship be- \\ntween beta-endorphins and mood change with exercise seems to be related \\nto the blood-brain barrier (i.e., endothelial cell layer surrounding the cap- \\nillaries) which is relatively impermeable to peptides and other large mol- \\necules circulating in the blood stream. Therefore, changes in peripheral \\nlevels of beta-endorphins would not be expected to modify central ner- \\nvous system opiod activity or to be related to mood states. Identification \\nof physiological mechanisms possibly underlying the relationship between \\nexercise and mood is an important area of future research. \\nPsychological mechanisms also may influence the relationship between \\nexercise and mood alteration. Potential psychological mechanisms include \\nthe following: improved self-concept, feelings of self-efficacy, enjoyment, \\nexpectancy of psychological benefits, “time out” from one’s routine and \\ndaily hassles, and an increased sense of control (e.g., Berger, 1996; Ber- \\nger, Owen, & Man, 1993; Morgan, 1985). To examine a possible rela- \\ntionship between self-concept and acute mood alteration, McInman and \\nBerger (1993) administered Shacham’s (1983) abbreviated version of the \\nPOMS and Self-Description Questionnaire I11 (Marsh, 1992) to women \\nimmediately before and after participating in aerobic dance and to a con- \\ntrol group. Exercisers reported greater mood improvements and enhanced \\nself-concept than the controls. However, there was no evidence that \\nchanges in self-concept were related to the mood benefits associated with \\nexercise. Examining another possible mechanism, Motl et al. (in press) \\nfound that enjoyment was associated with acute mood changes on the \\nPOMS for rock-climbers and health-education students who listened to a \\nlecture and watched a video of rock-climbing. Recently, Berger, Owen, \\nMotl, and Parks (1998) examined whether expectancy of psychological \\nbenefits was related to mood changes after jogging. Despite significant \\nacute mood benefits, expectancy of psychological benefits were not con- \\nclusively related to the significant changes on the POMS subscales of \\ntension, depression, anger, and confusion. Continued research employing \\nthe POMS will help illuminate whether other hypotheses such as “time \\nout” and an increased sense of control are viable mechanisms for mood \\nalteration. \\nNew Directions: Exercise and Mood Alteration Research \\nAs illustrated by the need to search for mechanisms underlying the \\nrelationship between exercise and mood alteration, there still are many \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 17, 'page_label': '18'}, page_content='EXERCISE AND MOOD AS MEASURED BY THE POMS 85 \\nunexplored areas of research which may benefit from using the POMS. \\nPossible research directions include examining the mood changes asso- \\nciated with exercise for individuals suffering from specific diseases such \\nas acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or affective disorders. \\nOther interesting areas of needed research concerning the exercise-mood \\nrelationship include the role of environmental factors such as music, tele- \\nvision, exercise class size, and crowdedness. Finally, the relationship be- \\ntween mood change and individual characteristics of the exerciser such \\nas self-presentational concerns, social-physique anxiety, and preferred lev- \\nel of exertion also need investigation. In the following sections, the lim- \\nited research using the POMS to investigate these areas is discussed. \\nSpecific Populations \\nInitial diagnosis of HIV-1 infection is a frightening event and probably \\nhas a host of psychological consequences such as fear, anxiety, depres- \\nsion, and anger. These negative affective states may have important con- \\nsequences for HIV- 1 progression, especially since affective states may \\ninfluence cell-mediated immunity (Kiecolt-Glasser & Glasser, 1996; \\nMaier et al., 1994). Exercise interventions that do not deplete energy \\nstores may decrease emotional distress and thereby enhance the immune \\nsystem. This possible buffering effect would appear to be important dur- \\ning both initial infection and the later stages of HIV-1 progression. Illus- \\ntrating the positive role of exercise on indices of mood and immune func- \\ntion during initial diagnosis of HIV- 1 infection, LaPerriere and associates \\n( 1990) indicated that non-exercisers reported greater mood decrements on \\nthe POMS subscales of tension and depression than did exercisers fol- \\nlowing initial notification of positive serologic HIV-1 status. Exercisers \\ndiagnosed with HIV-1A also demonstrated more positive immune func- \\ntioning as measured by CD56 (natural killer cells) and CD4 (T-helper/ \\ninducer) than non-exercisers with positive HIV- 1A status (LaPerriere et \\nal., 1990). In light of the positive effect of exercise on both mood and \\nimmune function during initial HIV-1 diagnosis, further research is need- \\ned to assess the interactive role of immune status, chronic exercise, and \\nmood states during different stages of disease progression. \\nPsychologists, psychiatrists, and exercise specialists have suggested \\nthat physical activity can be a treatment modality for individuals with \\nanxiety and depressive mood disorders (e.g., Martinsen, 1993; Martinsen \\n& Morgan, 1997; Raglin, 1997). Additional research on the efficacy of \\nexercise for treating clinical anxiety and depression is necessary, espe- \\ncially research utilizing the POMS which was developed initially for psy- \\nchiatric outpatient populations. As noted in the earlier section on mood \\nchanges in clinical populations, this group of individuals has reported \\nchronic mood benefits associated with therapeutic exercise programs (Fre- \\nmont & Craighead, 1987; Steptoe et al., 1989). Exercise may be an ef- \\nfective, low cost alternative to traditional approaches for treating affective \\ndisorders as measured by the POMS (Berger, 1996; Martinsen, 1993; \\nDownloaded by [Bowling Green SU] at 11:14 09 February 2015'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'iText 4.2.0 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Acrobat 5.0 Paper Capture Plug-in for Windows', 'creationdate': '2007-03-25T12:47:18+05:30', 'moddate': '2015-02-09T11:14:54-08:00', 'source': 'data/ExerciseandMood.pdf', 'total_pages': 25, 'page': 18, 'page_label': '19'}, page_content='86 BERGER AND MOTL \\nMartinsen & Morgan, 1997: Nelson & Morgan, 1994). However, exercise \\ndoes not seem to be a commonly accepted treatment modality for clinical \\npopulations. Additional research with this specific population might assist \\nin bringing exercise interventions into main stream treatment programs. \\nEnviroiimentL-rl Injluences \\nDirectors of many gymnasiums, health clubs, and other workout sites \\nare providing music and television for many reasons: to attract exercisers, \\nto encourage pulsating workouts, and to distract people from the physical \\nsensation of effortful exercise. Unfortunately, the effects of music and \\ntelevision on mood are not clear. Some individuals may find that listening \\nto music or viewing television during exercise is enjoyable and mood \\nenhancing; others may not. Steptoe and Cox (1988) examined whether \\nlively, stimulating music moderated mood changes as measured by the \\nPOMS after participation in high- and low-intensity bicycle ergometry. \\nThere was no evidence that music was differentially associated with mood \\nchanges at either exercise intensity. We are not aware of any research \\nexamining the influence of exercising while either watching television or \\nreading on the relationship between exercise and mood alteration. The \\npotential influences of these distracting activities during exercise are need- \\ned areas of investigation. \\nCrowded environments, the size of exercise groups, and leadership may \\ninfluence exercise enjoyment and mood alteration. Crowded exercise en- \\nvironments such as those encountered in some weight rooms may detract \\nfrom mood benefits after exercise. Waiting in line for an exercise machine \\nmay be stressful and annoying for some individuals and thus may be \\ncounterproductive to mood improvement. In addition to crowded envi- \\nronments, class or group size may be inversely related to enjoyment of \\nexercise (Widmeyer, Brawley, & Carron, 1990). Large exercise groups \\nmay be less enjoyable than smaller ones, and this would seem to have \\nimplications for mood alteration. Conversely, smaller exercise groups may \\nbe more conducive to desirable mood changes than larger groups. Exer- \\ncise leaders also may inadvertently and unknowingly affect mood alter- \\nation. In conclusion, the relationship between mood alteration and the \\nfactors of facility crowdedness, group or class size, and leadership quality \\nare promising areas for future research. \\nPersonal Characteristics \\nSelf-presentational concerns and social-physique anxiety also may im- \\npact mood alteration. Self-presentation involves the processes by which \\nan individual attempts to monitor and control the impressions that other \\npeople form of them (Leary, 1992). Social physique anxiety includes \\nfeelings of nervousness or discomfort associated with public evaluation \\nof one’s physical appearance (Hart, Leary, & Rejeski, 1989). Exercise \\nenvironments are particularly salient settings for self-presentation con- \\ncerns and social-physique anxiety.

Individuals who are mo- \\ntivated to self-present while exercising may focus on incorrect exercise \\ncues and may exercise too intensely (Leary, 1992) to experience enjoy- \\nment or mood benefits. People who are high in physique-related anxiety \\nare more likely to experience nervousness, discomfort, and less exercise \\nenjoyment in body-conscious settings while exercising. (Hart et al., 1989; \\nLeary, 1992). Thus, social-physique anxiety may be detrimental to acute \\nmood benefits. The possible influences of social-physique anxiety and \\nself-presentational concerns on the mood changes associated with physi- \\ncal activity need direct investigation. \\nAnother individual characteristic that may affect mood alteration is \\npreferred level of exertion. Although many individuals follow the fitness \\nguidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (1995) or the \\nworkout suggestions of personal trainers, these “training” guidelines may \\nnot be conducive to mood improvements. To maximize the psychological \\nbenefits of exercise, an individual may need to exercise at an intensity \\nthat is personally enjoyable. There is a need to examine the differential \\neffects of preferred level of exertion in comparison to other experimenter- \\nselected intensities on mood alteration. \\nConclusions \\nThe past 25 years of research using the POMS in exercise settings has \\njust begun to uncover the complex inter-relationships. The POMS has \\nbeen a potent, reliable, and valid measure of mood in physical activity \\nsettings. The growing body of research demonstrating the benefits of ex- \\nercise for acute improvements on the tension, depression, anger, and con- \\nfusion subscales and sometimes on the vigor and fatigue subscales has \\nsupported the potency of the POMS. Based on the large body of research \\nusing the POMS, Berger and colleagues (Berger, 1996; Berger et al., \\n1988, 1997; Berger & Owen, 1988, 1992a, 1992b, 1998; Mot1 et al., in \\npress) have developed a taxonomy containing enjoyment, mode, and \\ntraining guidelines to facilitate the mood benefits of physical activity and \\nto serve as a guide for future research. Supporting the need for continued \\ninvestigation of the taxonomy factors, Morgan (1997a) concluded that \\nthere is a “. . .need to address the related issues of exercise mode (e.g., \\nrunning, walking); intensity (e.g., low, moderate, high); duration (e.g., 15, \\n30, 45 min); frequency (e.g., 1, 3, 5 days per week); preferred versus \\nprescribed exertion levels;. . .” (p. 231). The POMS also has been em- \\nployed to identify possible mechanisms that may influence the relation- \\nship between exercise and mood alteration. Unfortunately, there is little \\nevidence to identify a single or group of mechanisms that consistently \\ninfluence the mood benefits associated with physical activity. \\nMuch remains to be studied regarding the exercise-mood relationship. \\nExamining mood changes in specific populations, the environmental in- \\nfluences of mood alteration, and individual factors affecting mood in ex- \\nercise are promising avenues for future investigation.
