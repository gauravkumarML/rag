Stochastic calculus is a branch of mathematics that extends traditional calculus to stochastic processes, 
which are systems that evolve randomly over time. It provides a framework for integrating and 
differentiating non-smooth random functions and is essential for modeling and analyzing complex systems in 
fields like finance, where it is used for option pricing and risk management, as well as in physics and engineering. 
The field was pioneered by Japanese mathematician Kiyosi Itô, who developed key concepts like the stochastic integral and 
stochastic differential equations.
